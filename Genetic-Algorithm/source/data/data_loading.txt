#red
Definitions:

#green
ammount of chromosomes >0
#yellow
ammount of arrays of bits like that: {0,1,0,0,0,1}


#green
ammount of genes >0
#yellow
ammount of bits in array  {0,1,0,0,0,1} <=> 6 genes

#green
crossover propability <0;1>
#yellow
This sets how likely to crossover two different chromosomes


#green
mutatuin propability <0;1>
#yellow
This sets how likely to mutate each gene 
for example:
1 <=> bit before mutation
0 <=> bit after mutation
